Photo by Qwelk Ancient Egypt - Biography Akhenaten Biography >> Ancient Egypt Occupation: Pharaoh of Egypt Born: Around 1380 BC Died: 1336 BC Reign: 1353 BC to 1336 BC Best known for: Changing the religion of Ancient Egypt and building the city of Amarna Biography: Akhenaten was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt. He is famous for changing the traditional religion of Egypt from the worship of many gods to the worship of a single god named Aten. Growing Up Akhenaten was born in Egypt around 1380 BC. He was the second son to the Pharaoh Amenhotep III. When his older brother died, Akhenaten became the crown prince of Egypt. He grew up in the royal palace learning about how to be the leader of Egypt. Becoming Pharaoh Some historians think that Akhenaten served as a "co-pharaoh" alongside his father for several years. Others do not. Either way, Akhenaten took over as pharaoh around the year 1353 BC when his father died. Under his father's rule, Egypt had become one of the most powerful and wealthy nations in the world. The civilization of Egypt was at its peak around the time Akhenaten took control. Changing His Name When Akhenaten became pharaoh, he still had his birth name of Amenhotep. His formal title was Pharaoh Amenhotep IV. However, around the fifth year of his reign as pharaoh, he changed his name to Akhenaten. This new name represented his belief in a new religion that worshiped the sun god Aten. It meant "Living Spirit of Aten." Changing the Religion Once he became pharaoh, Akhenaten decided to reform the Egyptian religion. For thousands of years the Egyptians had worshiped a variety of gods such as Amun, Isis, Osiris, Horus, and Thoth. Akhenaten, however, believed in a single god named Aten. Akhenaten built a number of temples to his new god. He also had many of the old temples closed and removed some of the old gods from inscriptions. Many of the Egyptian people and priests were not happy with him for this. Amarna Around 1346 BC, Akhenaten decided to build a city to honor the god Aten. The city was called Akhetaten by the Ancient Egyptians. Today, archeologists call it Amarna. Amarna became the capital city of Egypt during Akhenaten's reign. It housed the royal palace and the Great Temple of the Aten. Queen Nefertiti Bust Author: Thutmose. Photo by Zserghei. Queen Nefertiti Akhenaten's main wife was Queen Nefertiti. Nefertiti was a very powerful queen. She ruled alongside Akhenaten as the second most powerful person in Egypt. Today, Nefertiti is famous for a sculpture of her that shows how beautiful she was. She is often referred to in history as "the most beautiful woman in the world." Changing Art Along with a change in religion, Akhenaten brought a dramatic change to Egyptian art. Prior to Akhenaten, people were presented with ideal faces and perfect bodies. During Akhenaten's reign, artists depicted people more how they really looked. This was a dramatic change. Some of the most beautiful and unique artwork from Ancient Egypt comes from this time period. Death and Legacy Akhenaten died around 1336 BC. Archeologists are unsure who took over as pharaoh, but it appears that there were two pharaohs who ruled for a short time before Akhenaten's son, Tutankhamun became pharaoh. It wasn't long after Akhenaten's reign that Egypt returned to its traditional religion. The capital city moved back to Thebes and eventually the city of Amarna was abandoned. Later pharaohs had Akhenaten's name removed from the lists of pharaohs because he went against the traditional gods. He was sometimes referred to as "the enemy" in Egyptian records. Interesting Facts About Akhenaten His religious leanings were likely influenced by his mother, Queen Tiye. The city of Amarna was abandoned not long after Akhenaten's death. It is likely that Akhenaten suffered from a disorder called Marfan's Syndrome. He was probably buried at the royal tomb in Amarna, but his body was not found there. It may have been destroyed or possibly moved to the Valley of the Kings. Activities Listen to a recorded reading of this page: Your browser does not support the audio element.

It was a time of peace when art and Egyptian culture flourished. Growing Up Amenhotep III was the son of Pharaoh Thutmose IV and the great-grandson of the legendary Pharaoh Thutmose III. He grew up in the royal palace as the crown prince of Egypt. He would have been educated on the workings of the Egyptian government as well as the religious responsibilities of the pharaoh. Becoming Pharaoh When Amenhotep was around twelve years old his father died and Amenhotep was crowned pharaoh. He likely had an adult regent who ruled for him for the first few years as he grew older and learned how to lead. Ruling Egypt Amenhotep took over Egypt at a time when the country was very rich and powerful. He was a very capable politician. He maintained his power over Egypt by reducing the power of the priests of Amun and elevating the sun god Ra. He also made strong alliances with foreign powers by marrying the daughters of foreign kings from Babylon and Syria. Family Just a few years after becoming pharaoh, Amenhotep married his wife Tiye. Tiye became his queen and "Great Royal Wife." They had several children together including two sons. Amenhotep's first son, Crown Prince Thutmose, died at a fairly young age. This made his second son Amenhotep IV first in line for the crown. Amenhotep IV would later change his name to Akhenaten when he became pharaoh. In order to strengthen alliances with foreign nations, Amenhotep married several princesses from bordering kingdoms. Despite having so many wives, it seems that Amenhotep had strong feelings for his first wife Queen Tiye. He built a lake in her honor in her home town and also had a mortuary temple built for her. Colossi of Memnon Author: Unknown photographer Monument Building During his time as pharaoh, Amenhotop III built many monuments to himself and the gods. Perhaps his most famous construction was the Temple of Luxor in Thebes. This temple became one of the grandest and most famous temples in Egypt. Amenhotep also built hundreds of statues of himself including the Colossi of Memnon. These two giant statues tower around 60 feet tall and show a giant Amenhotep in a sitting position. Death Amenhotep III died around the year 1353 BC. He was buried in the Valley of Kings in a tomb along with his wife Tiye. His son, Amenhotep IV, became pharaoh upon his death. His son would change his name to Akhenaten and make huge changes to the Egyptian religion. Interesting Facts About Amenhotep III The name Amenhotep means "Amun is Satisfied." Amun was the main god of the Egyptians. He built an extravagant mortuary temple to himself. It was later flooded by the Nile River and much of it is in ruins today. There are more surviving statues (around 250) of Amenhotep III than any other Pharaoh. Although Amenhotep married many foreign princesses, when the King of Babylon asked to marry Amenhotep's daughter, he refused. He is sometimes called Amenhotep the Magnificent. He was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Activities Listen to a recorded reading of this page: Your browser does not support the audio element.

Her father was the Pharaoh Ptolemy XII. Cleopatra was smart and cunning growing up. She was her father's favorite child and learned a lot about how the country was ruled from him. Cleopatra by Louis le Grand Cleopatra's family had ruled Egypt for 300 years. They were the Ptolemy dynasty that had been established by the Greek ruler Alexander the Great. Even though they ruled Egypt, they were actually of Greek descent. Cleopatra grew up speaking, reading, and writing Greek. Unlike many of her relatives, however, Cleopatra also learned many other languages including Egyptian and Latin. Her Father Dies When Cleopatra was eighteen years old her father died. He left the throne to both her and her younger brother, Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra and her ten-year-old brother were married and were to rule Egypt as co-rulers. Because she was much older, Cleopatra quickly took control as the main ruler of Egypt. However, as her brother grew older he began to want more power. Eventually he forced Cleopatra from the palace and took over as Pharaoh. Julius Caesar In 48 BC, Julius Caesar arrived in Egypt. Cleopatra snuck back into the palace hidden inside a rolled up carpet. She met with Caesar and convinced him to help her win back the throne. Caesar defeated Ptolemy's army at the Battle of the Nile and Ptolemy drowned in the Nile River while trying to escape. Cleopatra then took back power. She would first rule alongside another younger brother, Ptolemy XIV, and later, after Ptolemy XIV died, she ruled with her son Ptolemy Caesarion.

Marc Antony In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was assassinated and Cleopatra returned to Egypt. One of the three leaders to emerge in Rome after Caesar's death was Marc Antony. In 41 BC, Cleopatra and Marc Antony met and fell in love. They also formed a military alliance against another of Rome's leaders, Octavian. Octavian was the legal heir of Julius Caesar. Cleopatra wanted her son, Caesarion, to be Caesar's heir and to eventually become ruler of Rome. She hoped that Marc Antony could help her achieve this goal. Fighting Rome Cleopatra and Marc Antony combined their armies in order to fight Octavian. The two forces met at the Battle of Actium. Antony and Cleopatra were defeated by Octavian and had to retreat to Egypt. Death The death of Cleopatra is shrouded with mystery and romance. After fleeing to Egypt, Marc Antony returned to the battlefield hoping to recover and defeat Octavian. He soon realized that he was going to be captured by Octavian. Upon hearing the false news that Cleopatra had died, Antony killed himself. When Cleopatra heard that Antony was dead, she became very sad. She killed herself by allowing a poisonous cobra to bite her. With Cleopatra's death, Octavian took control of Egypt and it became part of the Roman Empire. Her death brought an end to the Ptolemy dynasty and the Egyptian Empire. She was the last Pharaoh of Egypt.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Hatshepsut History >> Biography >> Ancient Egypt for Kids Occupation: Pharaoh of Egypt Born: 1508 BC Died: 1458 BC Best known for: The most powerful woman pharaoh Biography: A Princess Hatshepsut was born an Egyptian princess. Her father was the Pharaoh Thutmose I. She grew up in the great royal courts of Egypt with her sister and two brothers. Unfortunately, Hatshepsut's brothers and sister died while they were still young. Now she was an only child. Without a son to inherit the throne, Thutmose I was worried who would be pharaoh after he died. He decided to name one of Hatshepsut's step-brothers as heir. This is where things get weird. Hatshepsut was married to her step-brother in order to keep the royal line pure. This sounds really strange today, but it was common for Egyptian royalty. A Queen Hatshepsut's dad died a short time after she was married and her husband became the pharaoh Thutmose II. Hatshepsut was now queen of Egypt. Thutmose II, however, was a sickly man. He ruled for only a few years before he died. During this time Hatshepsut had begun to take an active role in running the country. Egypt faced a problem, though. Hatshepsut had not had a son with Thutmose II. Now what would Egypt do for a leader? Regent The only male heir to the throne was a young boy that was Hatshepsut's nephew Thutmose III. He was crowned the new pharaoh of Egypt at a young age, but Hatshepsut was named regent. She would run the country for him. Becoming Pharaoh Hatshepsut was a powerful and intelligent leader. There were people in the government who were very loyal to her. After a few years of being regent, she decided to become Pharaoh. She had herself named Pharaoh. She took charge of the country. Ruling Egypt Hatshepsut was a gifted and cunning leader. She had to be to remain in power for 20 years as a woman pharaoh. Rather than go to war, she established trade relationships with many foreign countries. Through trade she made Egypt a rich nation. Her time of rule was a time of peace and prosperity. Building One way that Hatshepsut stayed in power was to construct many buildings and monuments throughout Egypt. She also had many statues of herself at these sites. This way the people continued to think of her as their leader and pharaoh. One of her most famous buildings was her mortuary temple at Djeser-Djeseru. This temple is considered one of the great achievements in Egyptian architecture. It was similar to the classical architecture that the Greeks would develop around a thousand years later and marked a major turning point in Egyptian architecture. Temple of Hatshepsut by Gocht Dressing like a Pharaoh In order for people to accept her as pharaoh, Hatshepsut began to dress like a pharaoh. She wore the pharaoh's headdress with a cobra. She even wore a fake beard and a short kilt like the men wore. Death After 22 years of rule Hatshepsut died. She probably died from a blood infection, but it is also known that her nephew, Thutmose III, was not fond of her. He may have had her assassinated. Thutmose III went on to become a great Pharaoh in his own right. Interesting Facts about Hatshepsut The name Hatshepsut means "Foremost of Noble Ladies". Her father Thutmose I was a general, but became Pharaoh because the previous Pharaoh did not have a son. Archeologists think that Thutmose III had many of the statues and references to Hatshepsut destroyed. As a way to justify becoming pharaoh, she claimed that she was the daughter of the god Amun.

He was both a military genius and brave warrior. He often fought on the front lines, leading his army into battle. Building Like many great pharaohs of the New Kingdom period, Thutmose III was a prolific builder. Egyptian writings record that he had over fifty temples built throughout Egypt. He made many additions to the Temple of Karnak at Thebes including new pylons and several towering obelisks. Death Thutmose III died around the year 1425 BC. He was buried in an elaborate tomb in the Valley of the Kings. Interesting Facts About Thutmose III Other spellings for his name include Thutmosis and Tuthmosis. His name means "Thoth is born." Thutmose treated the peoples he conquered well. They generally experienced peace and prosperity after becoming part of the Egyptian Empire. There are no records of Thutmose ever losing a battle. Some of the obelisks constructed by Thutmose are now in various places around the world. One is in Central Park in New York City and another is on the banks of the River Thames in London, England. They both have the strange nickname "Cleopatra's Needle." Activities Listen to a recorded reading of this page: Your browser does not support the audio element.

His father was the Pharaoh Akhenaten. Tutankhamun's birth name was Tutankhaten, which he changed after his father died. Tutankhamun was born to one of his father's lesser wives and not to his main wife, the powerful Nefertiti. His presence may have caused some strain in the royal courts as Nefertiti had only daughters, but desperately wanted to have a son of her own to take over the throne. A Radical Father Tutankhamun's father was a religious radical. He changed the entire religion of Ancient Egypt to worship only the sun god Aten. He did away with over a thousand years of traditional Egyptian religion and forced people to change the way they worshiped. He even built a new capital city in honor of the god Aten called Amarna. The Boy Pharaoh At the young age of seven years old Tutankhamun's father died. A few years later Tutankhamun married his sister (which was common for Pharaoh's in Ancient Egypt) and became Pharaoh. Since he was so young he had help ruling the country. The real rulers were a powerful general named Horemheb and Tutankhamun's vizier named Ay. Ruling Egypt Many people of Egypt had been unhappy with the religious reforms of his father. Tutankhamun and his advisors tried to fix all the changes that his father had made. Under Tutankhamun Egypt returned to their old gods and the old temples were repaired. The capital city was also moved back to the city of Memphis. He even changed his name from Tutankhaten, "the living image of Aten", to Tutankhamun, "the living image of Amun". Death and Burial Tutankhamun died around the age of nineteen. Archeologists aren't sure what killed him. Some people think that he was assassinated, but the likely cause of his death was a wound to his leg. Scientists have determined that the leg of his mummy was broken and badly infected before his death. This injury probably happened from an accident. Tomb Tutankhamun is most famous today for his tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It is likely that his tomb was built for someone else and was used to bury the young Pharaoh when he died unexpectedly. This may have helped to keep his tomb hidden from thieves for all these thousands of years. As a result, when the tomb was finally discovered by archeologist Howard Carter in 1922, it was filled with treasure and artifacts unlike found in any other Pharaoh's tomb. Interesting Facts about Tutankhamun Other spellings of his name include Tutankhamen and Tutankhamon. He is sometimes called King Tut today. He had no surviving children. The successor to his throne was the vizier Ay. It is likely that another Pharaoh or two ruled for a short time between Tutankhamun and his father Akhenaten. These Pharaoh's were Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. Comedian Steve Martin sung a funny song about Tutankhamun called "King Tut". There was a villain on the Batman TV series called King Tut.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Inventions and Technology Back to Ancient Egypt for Kids The Ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to form in the ancient world. Their inventions and technology had an impact on many civilizations to come. Their technology included the ability to build large construction projects such as pyramids and palaces, simple machines such as ramps and levers, and a complex system of government and religion. Writing One of the most important inventions of the Ancient Egyptians was writing. They wrote in hieroglyphics. You can learn more about hieroglyphics here. Writing allowed the Egyptians to keep accurate records and maintain control of their large empire. Papyrus Sheets The Egyptians learned how to make durable sheets of parchment from the papyrus plant. It was used for important documents and religious texts. The Egyptians kept the process to make the sheets a secret so they could sell the parchment to other civilizations such as Ancient Greece. Medicine The Ancient Egyptians had a wide variety of medicines and cures. Some of their medicines were quite strange. For example, they used honey and human brains to cure eye infections. They also used a whole cooked mouse to help cure coughs. Many of their medicines were accompanied by spells to ward off the evil spirits making the person sick. Shipbuilding With the Nile River playing a major role in the lives of the Egyptians, building ships was a big part of their technology. They originally built small boats from papyrus reeds, but later began to build large ships from cedar wood imported from Lebanon. Mathematics The Egyptians needed a good understanding of mathematics and geometry to build the pyramids and other large buildings. They also used math and numbers to keep track of business transactions. For numbers they used a decimal system. They didn't have numerals for 2 - 9 or zero. They just had numbers for factors of 10 such as 1, 10, 100, etc. In order to write the number 3 they would write down three number 1s. To write the number 40, they would write down four number 10s. Makeup All Egyptians wore makeup, even the men. They made a dark eye makeup called kohl from soot and other minerals. The makeup was a fashion statement, but it also had the side effect of protecting their skin from the hot desert sun. Toothpaste Because their bread had so much grit and sand in it, the Egyptians had a lot of problems with their teeth. They invented the toothbrush and toothpaste in an effort to take care of their teeth. They used a wide variety of ingredients to make their toothpaste including ashes, eggshells, and even ground up ox hooves. Fun Facts about the Inventions of Ancient Egypt The Ancient Egyptians did not start using the wheel until it was introduced by foreign invaders using the chariot. The word for paper comes from the Greek word for the papyrus plant. The Egyptian number for one million was a picture of a god with his arms raised in the air. They invented a game similar to bowling where the bowler tried to roll a ball into a hole. They invented large door locks which used keys. Some of the keys were up to 2 feet long.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Boats and Transportation History >> Ancient Egypt The Egyptians didn't build roads to travel around their empire. They didn't need to. Nature had already built them a superhighway right through the middle of their empire called the Nile River. Most of the major cities in Ancient Egypt were located along the banks of the Nile River. As a result, the Egyptians used the Nile for transportation and shipping from very early on. They became experts at building boats and navigating the river. Egypt Tomb Oar boat by Unknown Early Boats Early Egyptians learned to make small boats out of the papyrus plant. They were easy to construct and worked well for fishing and short trips. Most of the papyrus boats were small and were steered with oars and poles. The typical boat was long and thin and the ends came to a point that stuck out of the water. Wooden Boats Eventually the Egyptians began to make boats from wood. They used acacia wood from Egypt and imported cedar wood from Lebanon. They also began to use a giant sail in the middle of the boat so they could catch the wind when heading upstream. The Egyptians built their wooden boats without nails. Boats were often made from a number of short planks that were hooked together and tied tight with ropes. Steering was accomplished by using a large rudder oar at the back of the ships. Cargo Ships The Egyptians learned how to build large and sturdy cargo ships. They sailed these up and down the Nile and into the Mediterranean Sea to trade with other countries. These ships could hold lots of cargo. Some ships were used to carry huge stones weighing as much as 500 tons from the rock quarry to where the pyramids were being constructed. Funeral Boats The Egyptians believed that a boat was needed in the afterlife in order to journey to the heavens. Sometimes a small model of a boat was buried with a person. Often times a full size boat was included in the tombs of Pharaohs and other wealthy Egyptians. There were 35 boats of some type in the pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. Model of a riverboat by Unknown Rowing or Sailing It turns out that the Nile had another great advantage for boating. When boats were traveling north, they would be going with the current. When the ships were traveling south, they generally had the wind blowing in their direction and would use a sail. The ships often had oars to gain even more speed when traveling in either direction. How do we know about the boats of Ancient Egypt? Very few boats from Ancient Egypt have survived for archeologists to study. However, because of the religious importance of boats, there are many surviving models and pictures of boats. These models and pictures tell archeologists a lot about how the boats were constructed and how they were used. Fun Facts about Egyptian Boats The first papyrus boats are estimated to have been made around 4000 BC. The Egyptians developed many types of boats. Some were specialized for fishing and traveling, while others were designed for carrying cargo or going to war. Temples and palaces were often connected to the Nile River using manmade canals. The Pharaoh used a magnificent boat covered with gold and fancy carvings. The Egyptian sun god was said to travel across the sky on a boat during the day and across the Underworld on a boat at night.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Army and Soldiers History >> Ancient Egypt History The original Egyptians were farmers, not fighters. They didn't see the need for an organized army. They were well protected by the natural boundaries of the desert that surrounded the empire. During the Old Kingdom, if the Pharaoh needed men to fight, he would call up the farmers to defend the country. However, eventually the Hyksos people located near northern Egypt became organized. They conquered Lower Egypt using chariots and advanced weapons. The Egyptians knew they now needed an army. They learned how to make powerful chariots and gathered a strong army with infantry, archers, and charioteers. They eventually took Lower Egypt back from the Hyksos. Egyptian Chariot by Abzt From that point Egypt began to maintain a standing army. During the New Kingdom the Pharaohs often led the army into battle and Egypt conquered much of the surrounding land, expanding the Egyptian Empire. Weapons Probably the most important weapon in the Egyptian army was the bow and arrow. The Egyptians used the composite bow that they learned about from the Hyksos. They could shoot arrows over 600 feet killing many enemies from long distance. The foot soldiers, also called the infantry, were armed with a variety of weapons including spears, axes, and short swords. Chariots Chariots were an important part of the Egyptian army. They were wheeled carriages pulled by two fast warhorses. Two soldiers rode in a chariot. One would drive the chariot and control the horses while the other would fight using a bow and arrow or spear. Armor The Egyptian soldiers seldom wore armor. Their main form of defense was a shield. When they did wear armor it was in the form of hardened leather straps. Life as an Egyptian Soldier Life as an Egyptian soldier was hard work. They trained to keep up their strength and endurance. They also trained on different types of weapons. If they were proficient with a bow, then they would become an archer. The army was often used for tasks other than fighting. After all, if Pharaoh was going to feed all these men, he was going to get some use out of them during times of peace. The army worked the fields during planting and harvest time. They also worked as laborers on a lot of the construction such as palaces, temples, and pyramids. Organization The head of the Egyptian army was the Pharaoh. Under the Pharaoh were two generals, one who led the army in Upper Egypt and one who led the army in Lower Egypt. Each army had three major branches: the Infantry, the Chariotry, and the Navy. The generals were usually close relatives to the Pharaoh. Fun Facts about the Army of Ancient Egypt The soldiers of the Egyptian army were well respected. They received plunder from battles as well as a plot of land when they retired. Sometimes young boys were signed up to be in the army as young as 5 years old. They didn't actually start fighting until they were 20 years old, however. Army divisions were often named after gods. The Egyptians often hired foreign mercenaries to fight for them, especially in battles that were away from the land of Egypt. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Timeline History >> Ancient Egypt Ancient Egypt was one of the oldest and longest lasting world civilizations. It was located along the Nile River in the northeast part of Africa and lasted for over three thousand years. Historians generally use two ways to outline the history of Ancient Egypt: 1. Dynasties: The first is by using the different dynasties that ruled Egypt. These are the families that had power and passed the leadership of Pharaoh down from one family member to another. Counting the Ptolemaic Dynasty set up by the Greeks, there were over 30 dynasties that ruled Ancient Egypt. This sounds like a lot at first, but remember this was over the course of 3000 years. 2. Kingdoms and Periods: There are also three primary kingdoms that historians use to define periods of Ancient Egypt. After each kingdom there is an "intermediate" period. The three kingdoms were the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms. Here is a brief outline of the timeline of the Ancient Egyptian civilization showing the Kingdoms, periods, and dynasties: Early Dynastic Period (2950 -2575 BC) - Dynasties I-III The Ancient Egyptian civilization begins. The first Pharaoh of Egypt, Menes, united the Upper and Lower parts of Egypt into a single civilization. He put the capitol at the midpoint of the two lands in a city called Memphis. During this time the Egyptians developed hieroglyphic writing which would be important for making records and running the government. Near the end of the Dynastic Period and the start of the Old Kingdom, the first pyramid is built by the Pharoah Djoser and the famous Egyptian Architect Imhotep. Old Kingdom (2575-2150 BC) - Dynasties IV-VIII The fourth dynasty begins and the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx are built. This is often called the Age of the Pyramids. The fourth dynasty is a time of peace and also a time when the sun god Re became prominent in the Egyptian religion.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Old Kingdom History >> Ancient Egypt The "Old Kingdom" is a period of time during the history of Ancient Egypt. It lasted from 2575 BC to 2150 BC. Over these 400 years, Egypt had a strong central government and a prosperous economy. The Old Kingdom is most famous as a time when many pyramids were built. What dynasties were during the Old Kingdom? The Old Kingdom spanned four major dynasties from the Third Dynasty to the Sixth Dynasty. The period reached its peak during the Fourth Dynasty when powerful pharaohs such as Sneferu and Khufu ruled. Sometimes the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties are included as part of the Old Kingdom. Pyramid of Djoser Photo by Max Gattringer Rise of the Old Kingdom The period before the Old Kingdom is called the Early Dynastic Period. Even though Egypt had become one country under the First Dynasty, it was under the rule of Pharaoh Djoser, founder of the Third Dynasty, that the central government became organized and strong. Government Under Pharaoh Djoser's rule, the land of Egypt was divided up into "nomes" (like states). Each nome had a governor (called a "nomarch") that reported to the pharaoh. Egypt became wealthy enough to build the first Egyptian pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser. The pharaoh was the head of both the government and the state religion. He was considered a god. Below the pharaoh was the vizier who ran many of the daily tasks of the government. Only the most powerful families gained an education and were taught to read and write. These people became the high-ranking government officials, priests, army generals, and scribes. Pyramids The Old Kingdom period is most famous for building pyramids. This includes the first pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser, and the largest pyramid, the Great Pyramid at Giza. The peak of the Old Period was during the Fourth Dynasty when pharaohs such as Sneferu and Khufu ruled. The Fourth Dynasty built the Giza complex including several large pyramids and the Great Sphinx. Fall of the Old Kingdom The central government began to weaken during the Sixth Dynasty. The governors (nomarchs) became very powerful and began to ignore the rule of the pharaoh. At the same time, the country suffered from drought and famine. Eventually the central government collapsed and Egypt broke up into several independent states. First Intermediate Period The period after the Old Kingdom is called the First Intermediate Period. This period lasted around 150 years. It was a time of civil war and chaos. Interesting Facts About the Old Kingdom of Egypt Pharaoh Pepi II, who ruled near the end of the Old Kingdom, was pharaoh for around 90 years. The capital city of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was Memphis. Art flourished during the Old Period. Many of the styles and images created during the Old Kingdom were imitated for the next 3000 years. The Old Kingdom is sometimes referred to as the "Age of Pyramids." Egypt established trade with many foreign civilizations during this period. They built trade ships to travel the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Much of what we know about the Old Kingdom comes from tombs, pyramids, and temples. The cities where people lived were largely made from mud and have long since been destroyed. Some historians say the Old Kingdom continued until the end of the Eighth Dynasty when the capital city moved away from Memphis. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

It lasted from 1975 BC to 1640 BC. The Middle Kingdom was the second peak period of the Ancient Egyptian civilization (the other two being the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom). During this time all of Egypt was united under a single government and Pharaoh. What dynasties ruled Egypt during the Middle Kingdom? The Middle Kingdom period was ruled by the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Dynasties. Historians sometimes include the Fourteenth Dynasty as well. Mentuhotep II by Unknown Rise of the Middle Kingdom During the First Intermediate Period, Egypt was divided and in political chaos. The Tenth Dynasty ruled northern Egypt, while the Eleventh Dynasty ruled the south. Around 2000 BC, a powerful leader named Mentuhotep II became king of southern Egypt. He launched an attack on the north and eventually reunited Egypt under one rule. This began the period of the Middle Kingdom. The City of Thebes Under the rule of Mentuhotep II, Thebes became the capital of Egypt. From that point forward, the city of Thebes would remain a major religious and political center throughout much of Ancient Egyptian history. Mentuhotep II built his tomb and mortuary complex near the city of Thebes. Later, many pharaohs of the New Kingdom would also be buried nearby at the Valley of the Kings. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years. During that time, he reestablished the pharaoh as the god-king of Egypt. He rebuilt the central government and expanded the borders of Egypt. Peak of the Middle Kingdom The Middle Kingdom reached its peak under the rule of the Twelfth Dynasty. The pharaohs of the time built a powerful standing army that protected the country from outside invaders and maintained control of the government. The greatest point of economic prosperity came during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III which lasted for 45 years. Art Block Statue by Unknown The arts of Ancient Egypt continued to develop during this time. A type of sculpture called the "block statue" became popular. It would continue to be a mainstay of Egyptian art for 2,000 years. The block statue was sculpted from a single piece of rock. It showed a man squatting with his arms folded on top of his knees. Writing and literature developed as well. For the first time in Ancient Egyptian history, writing was used for entertainment including writing stories and recording religious philosophy. Fall of the Middle Kingdom It was during the Thirteenth Dynasty that the pharaoh's control of Egypt began to weaken. Eventually, a group of kings in northern Egypt, called the Fourteenth Dynasty, split from southern Egypt. As the country fell into disarray, the Middle Kingdom collapsed and the Second Intermediate Period began. Second Intermediate Period The Second Intermediate Period is most famous for the rule of foreign invaders called the Hyksos. The Hyksos ruled northern Egypt from the capital city of Avaris until around 1550 BC. Interesting Facts About the Middle Kingdom of Egypt The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom often appointed their sons as coregents, which was kind of like a vice-pharaoh. The Pharaoh Senusret III was one of the most powerful leaders of the Middle Kingdom. He is sometimes called a "warrior-king" because he personally led his troops into battle. The Middle Kingdom is sometimes referred to as Egypt's "classical age" or "The Period of Reunification." During the Twelfth Dynasty, a new capital city was built called Itj Tawy.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt New Kingdom History >> Ancient Egypt The "New Kingdom" is a period of time during the history of Ancient Egypt. It lasted from around 1520 BC to 1075 BC. The New Kingdom was the golden age of the civilization of Ancient Egypt. It was a time of wealth, prosperity, and power. What dynasties ruled during the New Kingdom? The Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Egyptian Dynasties ruled during the New Kingdom. They included some of the most famous and powerful of all the Egyptian pharaohs such as Ramses II, Thutmose III, Hatshepsut, Tutankhamun and Akhentaten. Rise of the New Kingdom Before the New Kingdom of Egypt was a time called the Second Intermediate Period. During this time, a foreign people called the Hyksos ruled northern Egypt. Around 1540 BC, a ten-year-old named Ahmose I became king of Lower Egypt. Ahmose I became a great leader. He defeated the Hyksos and united all of Egypt under one rule. This began the period of the New Kingdom. Tomb at the Valley of the Kings Photo by Haloorange Egyptian Empire It was during the New Kingdom that the Egyptian Empire conquered the most lands. Pharaohs launched wide ranging expeditions taking over lands to the south (Kush, Nubia) and lands to the east (Israel, Lebanon, Syria). At the same time, Egypt expanded trade with many external nations and kings. They used gold mines in Nubia to gain great wealth and to import luxury goods from around the world. Temples The pharaohs of the New Kingdom used their wealth to build massive temples to the gods. The city of Thebes continued to be the cultural center of the empire. The Temple of Luxor was built at Thebes and grand additions were made to the Temple of Karnak. Pharaohs also built monumental Mortuary Temples to honor themselves as gods. These included Abu Simbel (built for Ramses II) and the Temple of Hatshepsut. Valley of the Kings One of the most famous archeological sites from the New Kingdom is the Valley of the Kings. Starting with the Pharaoh Thutmose I, the New Kingdom pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings for 500 years. The most famous tomb in the Valley of the Kings is the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun which was discovered largely intact. It was filled with treasure, art, and King Tut's mummy. Fall of the New Kingdom It was during the reign of Ramesses III that the powerful Egyptian Empire began to weaken. Ramesses III had to fight many battles including an invasion by the Sea Peoples and tribesmen from Libya. These wars, combined with severe drought and famine, caused unrest throughout Egypt. In the years after Ramesses III died, internal corruption and infighting in the central government became worse. The last pharaoh of the New Kingdom was Ramesses XI. After his reign, Egypt was no longer united and the Third Intermediate Period began. Third Intermediate Period The Third Intermediate Period was a time when Egypt was generally divided and under attack from foreign powers. They first came under attack from the Kingdom of Kush from the south. Later, the Assyrians attacked and managed to conquer much of Egypt around 650 BC. Interesting Facts About the New Kingdom of Egypt There were eleven pharaohs who had the name Ramesses (or Ramses) during the the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. This period is sometimes called the Ramesside period. Hatshepsut was one of the few women who became pharaoh. She ruled Egypt for around 20 years. The Egyptian Empire was at its largest during the rule of Thutmose III. He is sometimes called the "Napoleon of Egypt." Pharaoh Akhenaten converted from the traditional religion of Egypt to the worship of one all-powerful god named Aten. He built a new capital city named Amarna in the honor of Aten.

It was a time when Egypt was united under Egyptian rulers. However, this didn't last long. Around 525 BC, the Persians conquered Egypt and the Achaemenid Period of Egypt began. What dynasties ruled during the Late Period? The Twenty-Sixth Dynasty of Egypt ruled for 125 years during the Late Period. This dynasty is sometimes called the Saite Period because the capital city was called Sais. The Twenty-Seventh Dynasty began when the Persians conquered Egypt. In the years before the Greeks arrived, power changed hands often with four short lived dynasties (Twenty-Eighth to the Thirty-First) ruling Egypt. Egypt Reunites Egypt had been divided during the Third Intermediate Period. It was the invasion of the Assyrians that caused Egypt to reunite to fight off foreign invaders. Under the leadership of Pharaoh Psamtik II Egypt united and the Late Period began. Psamtik II, and the later leaders of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, sought to return Egypt to its former glory. They re-established many of the old traditions including building great monuments to the pharaohs and the gods. They also fought off invasions from a new foreign threat, the Babylonians. The Persians Invade In 525 BC, the Persian Empire, led by King Cambyses II, invaded Egypt. They soundly defeated the Egyptian army at the Battle of Pelusium and took control of Egypt. Egypt Under Persia When the Persian Empire conquered Egypt, it was the largest empire in the world. Egypt then became a "satrapy" (like a province) of the Persian Empire. The leaders of the satrapy became known as the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty. Persia ruled over Egypt for 100 years. Egypt prospered under the rule of the Persian King Darius I. Darius built temples and presented himself like a pharaoh to Egypt. However, later Persian leaders, such as Xerxes, treated Egypt cruelly causing much inner turmoil and rebellion. Alexander the Great Invades Persian rule came to an end with the invasion of Alexander the Great in 332 BC. He defeated the Persians and brought Egypt into his vast empire. After Alexander died, a Greek leader named Ptolemy I Soter took control of Egypt and established the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Interesting Facts About the Late Period and Persian Rule Pharaoh Neko II attempted to build a canal from the Red Sea to the Nile River. Psamtik II allied with the Greeks to help oust the Assyrians from Egypt. During the late period, several different peoples and cultures from around the Mediterranean impacted the culture of Egypt.

When Alexander the Great died, his kingdom was divided among his generals. One of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, became pharaoh of Egypt. He established the Ptolemaic Dynasty in 305 BC. Bust of Ptolemy I Soter Photo by Marie-Lan Nguyen The Ptolemaic Dynasty The Ptolemaic Dynasty was the last dynasty of Ancient Egypt. Although Ptolemy I and later rulers were Greek, they took on the religion and many traditions of Ancient Egypt. At the same time, they introduced many aspects of Greek culture into the Egyptian way of life. For many years, Egypt prospered under the rule of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Many temples were built in the style of the New Kingdom. At its peak, around 240 BC, Egypt expanded to control Libya, Kush, Palestine, Cyprus, and much of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria During this time, Alexandria became one of the most important cities in the Mediterranean. It served as the major trade port between Asia, Africa, and Europe. It also was the center of Greek culture and education. The Library of Alexandria was the largest library in the world with several hundred thousand documents. Decline of the Ptolemaic Dynasty When Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, the Ptolemaic Dynasty began to weaken. The government became corrupt and many rebellions occurred throughout the country. At the same time, the Roman Empire was becoming stronger and taking over much of the Mediterranean.

The two sides met at the Battle of Actium where Cleopatra and Mark Antony were soundly defeated. One year later, Octavian arrived in Alexandria and defeated the Egyptian army. Roman Rule In 30 BC, Egypt became an official Roman province. Daily life in Egypt changed little under Roman rule. Egypt became one of the most important provinces of Rome as a source of grain and as a trade center. For several hundred years, Egypt was a source of great wealth for Rome. When Rome split in the 4th century, Egypt became a part of the Eastern Roman Empire (also called Byzantium).

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Geography and the Nile River History >> Ancient Egypt The Nile River played an important role in shaping the lives and society of Ancient Egypt. The Nile provided the Ancient Egyptians with food, transportation, building materials, and more. About the Nile River Map of the Nile River by Ducksters The Nile River is the longest river in the world. It is over 4,100 miles long! The Nile is located in northeast Africa and flows through many different African countries including Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Burundi. There are two major tributaries that feed the Nile, the White Nile and the Blue Nile. Upper and Lower Egypt The Nile River flows north through Egypt and into the Mediterranean Sea. Ancient Egypt was divided into two regions, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. This looks a bit confusing on a map because Upper Egypt is to the south and Lower Egypt is to the north. This is because the names come from the flow of the Nile River. Fertile Land The most important thing the Nile provided to the Ancient Egyptians was fertile land. Most of Egypt is desert, but along the Nile River the soil is rich and good for growing crops. The three most important crops were wheat, flax, and papyrus. Wheat - Wheat was the main staple food of the Egyptians. They used it to make bread. They also sold a lot of their wheat throughout the Middle East helping the Egyptians to become rich. Flax - Flax was used to make linen cloth for clothing. This was the main type of cloth used by the Egyptians. Papyrus - Papyrus was a plant that grew along the shores of the Nile. The Ancient Egyptians found many uses for this plant including paper, baskets, rope, and sandals. Flooding Around September of each year the Nile would overflow its banks and flood the surrounding area. This sounds bad at first, but it was one of the most important events in the life of the Ancient Egyptians. The flood brought rich black soil and renewed the farmlands. Building Material The Nile River also provided a lot of building materials for the Ancient Egyptians. They used the mud from the riverbanks to make sundried bricks. These bricks were used in building homes, walls, and other buildings. The Egyptians also quarried limestone and sandstone from the hills along the side of the Nile. Transportation Since most of the major cities of Ancient Egypt were built along the Nile River, the river could be used like a major highway throughout the Empire. Boats constantly traveled up and down the Nile carrying people and goods. Seasons of the Nile The Egyptians even built their calendar around the Nile River. They divided their calendar up into three seasons. Akhet, or inundation, was considered the first season and was the time of the flooding of the Nile. The other two seasons were Peret, the growing season, and Shemu, the harvest season. Fun Facts about the Nile River The Ancient Egyptians called the rich black soil from the floods the "Gift of the Nile". Today, the Aswan Dam keeps the Nile from flooding modern cities. The Ancient Egyptians called the Nile the "Aur", which means "black" and comes from the black soil. The Egyptians measured the height of the annual flood using a Nilometer. This helped them to determine how good the crops would be that year. The cause of the flood each year was heavy rains and melting snow to the south near the source of the Nile. The Ancient Egyptians believed that the flood was caused by the tears of the goddess Isis as she cried for her dead husband Osiris. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Cities History >> Ancient Egypt The cities of Ancient Egypt developed along the Nile River due to the fertile farmland along its banks. The typical city had a wall around it with two entrances. There was a major road down the center of the town with smaller, narrow streets connecting to it. The houses and buildings were made of mud-brick. If a building was destroyed in a flood, generally a new building was just built on top of it. Some cities in Ancient Egypt were specialized. For example, there were political towns that housed government workers and officials such as the capital cities of Memphis and Thebes. Other towns were religious towns centered around a major temple. Still other towns were built to house workers for major construction projects like the pyramids. Capital Cities The largest and most important cities in Ancient Egypt were the capital cities. The capital city moved over the course of time. The first capital city was Thinis. Some of the later capitals include Memphis, Thebes, Avaris, Akhetaten, Tanis, Sais, and Alexandria. Memphis - Memphis was the capital of Egypt from 2950 BC to 2180 BC. Some historians estimate that, during its peak, Memphis was the largest city in the world. Memphis continued to be a large and important city in Egypt even after the capital was moved to Thebes. It was also a center of religion with many temples. The main god of Memphis was Ptah, the creator god and the god of craftsmen. Thebes - Thebes first became the capital of Egypt around 2135 BC. It served off and on as capital until around 1279 BC. Thebes and Memphis generally rivaled each other as the largest and greatest cities in Egypt. Thebes was an important political and religious city.

The pharaoh created his own religion that worshiped the god Aten. He built the city to honor Aten. It was abandoned shortly after Akhenaten died. Other Cities Abydos - Abydos is a very old Egyptian city dating back to before the Old Kingdom. The city was considered one of the most holy places in Egypt because it was believed that the god Osiris was buried there. As a result, several temples were built in the city. The most famous surviving building is the Temple of Seti I. Also, some of the first pharaohs of Egypt were buried near Abydos. Hermopolis - The city of Hermopolis, also called Khmunu, was located on the border between Upper and Lower Egypt. it was a wealthy resort town, but also a center of religion. Egyptian mythology said that the first sunrise occurred over this city. The primary god worshiped here was Thoth. Crocodilopolis - Crocodilopolis was the Greek name for the city of Shedet. It was home to the cult of the crocodile god Sobek. Archeologists believe this city was founded around 4000 BC. Today the city is called Faiyum and it is the oldest city in Egypt. Elephantine - This city was on an island at the border between Nubia and Egypt. The city served as both a defensive fort and a trade center. It was home to the god of the waters, Khnum. Kom Ombo - Kom Ombo was a trade center where many trade routes passed from Nubia to the rest of Egypt. The city later became famous for the Temple of Kom Ombo.

Photo by Haloorange How Many Tombs are in the Valley of the Kings? There are over 60 tombs in the Valley of the Kings. They vary from small tombs that are little more than a large hole in the ground to very large tombs with over 100 underground chambers. Unfortunately, most of the tombs were looted thousands of years ago and the treasure was stolen or removed by thieves. There is artwork on the walls, however, that allows archeologists to learn much about the lives of the Pharaohs and other leaders who were buried here. The one tomb that was discovered with much of the treasure and tomb still intact was that of Tutankhamun. The Tomb of Tutankhamun The most famous tomb in the Valley of the Kings is that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, sometimes called King Tut. It was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter and had been largely untouched by thieves and vandals. Carter found the tomb under the remains of some workmen's huts. This may be why it had not been found by tomb raiders. The tomb was packed with amazing artifacts including King Tut's mummy, a gold mask, and a solid gold inner coffin. The tomb contained several chambers including the burial chamber, antechamber, treasure chamber, and annex. Tut's Tomb from the New York Times King Tut's Curse There is a long standing mystery about the curse of King Tut's tomb. Rumor had it that a tablet inside the tomb had a curse on it and Howard Carter hid the tablet so his workers wouldn't know. However, the rumors of a curse are most likely made up. There weren't a lot of deaths or bad things that happened to those who opened the tomb or Tutankhamen's mummy. Who else was buried here? The first Pharaoh to be buried in the Valley of the Kings was Tuthmosis I. Over the next 500 years many more Pharaohs were buried here including many of the Rameses (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X), Hatshepsut, Amenhotep I, and Tutankhamun. Fun Facts about the Valley of the Kings Today tourists can visit many of the tombs including Tutankhamun's. There is graffiti on the tombs from other cultures and times including Greek, Latin, and Phoenician.

Archeologists think that the steps were built as stairways for the pharaoh to use to climb to the sun god. Later pyramids have more sloping and flat sides. These pyramids represent a mound that emerged at the beginning of time. The sun god stood on the mound and created the other gods and goddesses. How big were the pyramids? There are around 138 Egyptian pyramids. Some of them are huge. The largest is the Pyramid of Khufu, also called the Great Pyramid of Giza. When it was first built it was over 480 feet tall! It was the tallest man-made structure for over 3800 years and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It's estimated that this pyramid was made from 2.3 million blocks of rock weighing 5.9 million tons. Djoser Pyramid by Unknown How did they build them? How the pyramids were built has been a mystery that archeologists have been trying to solve for many years. It is believed that thousands of slaves were used to cut up the large blocks and then slowly move them up the pyramid on ramps. The pyramid would get slowly built, one block at a time. Scientists estimate it took at least 20,000 workers over 23 years to build the Great Pyramid of Giza. Because it took so long to build them, Pharaohs generally started the construction of their pyramids as soon as they became ruler. What's inside the pyramids? Deep inside the pyramids lays the Pharaoh's burial chamber which would be filled with treasure and items for the Pharaoh to use in the afterlife. The walls were often covered with carvings and paintings. Near the Pharaoh's chamber would be other rooms where family members and servants were buried. There were often small rooms that acted as temples and larger rooms for storage. Narrow passageways led to outside. Sometimes fake burial chambers or passages would be used to try and trick grave robbers. Because there was such valuable treasure buried within the pyramid, grave robbers would try to break in and steal the treasure. Despite the Egyptian's efforts, nearly all of the pyramids were robbed of their treasures by 1000 B.C. Khafre's Pyramid and the Great Sphinx Photo by Than217 Fun Facts about the Great Pyramids The Great Pyramid of Giza points very precisely to the north. The pyramids of Egypt are all built to the west of the Nile River. This is because the western side was associated with the land of the dead. The base of a pyramid was always a perfect square. They were built mostly of limestone. There were traps and curses put on the tombs and the pyramids to try and keep robbers out. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Great Pyramid of Giza History >> Ancient Egypt The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest of all the Egyptian pyramids and is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is located around 5 miles to the west of the Nile River near the city of Cairo, Egypt. Pyramids of Giza Photo by Edgar Gomes Giza Necropolis The Great Pyramid of Giza is part of a larger complex called the Giza Necropolis. There are two other major pyramids in the complex including the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. It also includes the Great Sphinx and several cemeteries. Why was the Great Pyramid built? The Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Khufu. The pyramid once held all the treasures that Khufu would take with him to the afterlife. How big is it? When the pyramid was built, it was around 481 feet tall. Today, because of erosion and the removal of the top piece, the pyramid is around 455 feet tall. At its base, each side is approximately 755 feet long. That's well over twice as long as a football field! In addition to being tall, the pyramid is a massive structure. It covers an area of over 13 acres and is constructed with around 2.3 million stone blocks. Each of the stone blocks is estimated to weigh over 2000 pounds. The Great Pyramid of Giza Photo by Daniel Csorfoly How long did it take to build it? It took 20,000 workers around 20 years to build the Great Pyramid. Its construction began around 2580 BC, shortly after Khufu became pharaoh, and was completed around 2560 BC. How did they build it? No one is quite sure how the pyramids were built. There are a lot of different theories as to how the Egyptians were able to lift such large stone blocks all the way up to the top of the pyramids. It is likely that they used ramps to move the stones up the sides of the pyramid. They may have used wooden sleds or water to help the stones slide better and reduce friction. Inside the Great Pyramid Inside of the Great Pyramid are three major rooms: the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Grand Gallery. Small tunnels and air shafts lead to the chambers from the outside. The King's Chamber is at the highest point in the pyramid of all the chambers. It contains a large granite sarcophagus. The Grand Gallery is a large passageway around 153 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 29 feet high. Other Pyramids The two other major pyramids at Giza are the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The Pyramid of Khafre was built by Khufu's son, Pharaoh Khafre. It originally stood 471 feet tall, just 10 feet shorter than the Great Pyramid. The Pyramid of Menkaure was built for Khufu's grandson, Pharaoh Menkaure. It originally was 215 feet tall. Interesting Facts about the Great Pyramid of Giza It is thought that the architect of the pyramid was Khufu's vizier (his second in command) named Hemiunu. There were three small pyramids next to the Great Pyramid built for Khufu's wives. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years until a spire was built on the Lincoln Cathedral in England in 1300. Recent evidence suggests that paid skilled workers built the Giza Pyramids, not slaves. Despite its name, archeologists do not think that the Queen's Chamber is where the queen was buried. No treasure was found inside the pyramid. It was likely looted by grave robbers over a thousand years ago. The pyramid was originally covered with flat polished white limestone. It would have had a smooth surface and shone brightly in the sun. These cover stones were removed to construct other buildings over the years. Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt The Great Sphinx History >> Ancient Egypt What is a Sphinx? A Sphinx is a mythological creature with the body of a lion and the head of a person. In Ancient Egypt a lot of times the head was that of a Pharaoh or a god. Why were they built? The Egyptians built sphinx statues to guard important areas such as tombs and temples. Khafre's Pyramid and the Great Sphinx by Than217 The Great Sphinx of Giza The most famous Sphinx is the Great Sphinx of Giza. It is one of the largest and oldest statues in the world. Archeologists believe that it was carved around 2500 BC and that the head is meant to be the likeness of the Pharaoh Khafra. The Great Sphinx faces the sunrise and guards the pyramid tombs of Giza. How big is it? The Great Sphinx is huge! It is 241 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 66 feet high. The eyes on the face are 6 feet tall, the ears over three feet tall, and the nose would have been nearly 5 feet long before it was knocked off. It is carved out of the bedrock in a trench at the Giza site. How did it originally look? Over the past 4500 years weather and erosion have taken their toll on the Great Sphinx. It is really amazing that so much of it is left for us to see. The original Sphinx would have looked a lot different. It had a long braided beard and a nose. It also was painted in bright colors. Archeologists think that the face and body were painted red, the beard was blue, and much of the headdress was yellow. That would have been an amazing site! What happened to its nose? No one is entirely sure exactly how the nose got knocked off. There are stories that Napoleon's men accidentally knocked off the nose, but that theory has proven untrue as pictures have been found without the nose prior to Napoleon's arrival. Other stories have the nose getting shot off in target practice by Turkish soldiers. Many people now believe that the nose was chiseled off by someone who considered the Sphinx evil. Legend of the Sphinx The Sphinx partially covered by sand by Félix Bonfils After the Sphinx was built, over the course of the next 1000 years it fell into disrepair. The entire body was covered in sand and only the head could be seen. Legend has it that a young prince named Thutmose fell asleep near the head of the Sphinx. He had a dream where he was told that if he restored the Sphinx he would become Pharaoh of Egypt. Thutmose restored the Sphinx and later became Pharaoh of Egypt. Fun Facts about the Sphinx There was also a famous Sphinx in Greek Mythology. It was a monster that terrorized Thebes, killing all those who could not solve its riddle. It was the Greeks who gave the name "sphinx" to the creature. The beard was likely added to the Sphinx during the period of the New Kingdom. A portion of the beard can be seen in the British Museum in London. Efforts are being made to preserve the Sphinx, but it continues to erode. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt King Tut's Tomb History >> Ancient Egypt During the thousands of years that have past since the pharaohs were buried in their tombs, treasure hunters and thieves have snuck into the tombs and taken nearly all of the treasure. However, in 1922 one tomb was discovered that was mostly untouched and was filled with treasure. It was the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Where is King Tut's tomb? The tomb is in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt. This was where the Pharaohs and powerful nobles were buried for around 500 years during the history of Ancient Egypt. Who found the tomb? By 1914 many archeologists believed that all of the Pharaoh's tombs in the Valley of the Kings had been found. However, one archeologist named Howard Carter didn't agree. He thought that the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun was still undiscovered. Carter searched the Valley of the Kings for five years finding little. The man funding his search, Lord Carnarvon, became frustrated and nearly stopped paying for Carter's search. Carter convinced Carnarvon to pay for one more year. The pressure was on. Carter had one more year to find something. In 1922, after six years of searching, Howard Carter found a step underneath some old workmen's huts. He soon uncovered a stairway and the door to King Tut's tomb. What would be inside it? Would it be empty like all the other tombs found before? Howard Carter inspecting the mummy of Tutankhamun Tut's Tomb from the New York Times What was found in the tomb? Once inside the tomb, Carter found rooms filled with treasure. This included statues, gold jewelry, Tutankhamun's mummy, chariots, model boats, canopic jars, chairs, and paintings. It was an amazing discovery and one of the most important made in the history of archeology. In all, there were over 5,000 objects in the tomb. It took Carter and his team ten years to catalog everything. Tutanhkamun tomb statueby Jon Bodsworth Golden funeral mask of king Tutankhamun by Jon Bodsworth How big was the tomb? The tomb was fairly small for a Pharaoh. Archeologists believe that it was built for an Egyptian noble, but was used for Tutankhamun when he died at a young age. The tomb had four main rooms: the antechamber, burial chamber, annex, and treasury. The antechamber was the first room that Carter entered. Among its many items included three funeral beds and the pieces of four chariots. The burial chamber contained the sarcophagus and King Tut's mummy. The mummy was contained in three nested coffins. The final coffin was made of solid gold. The treasury contained the king's canopic chest which held his organs. There were also many treasures such as gilded statues and model boats. The annex was full of all sorts of objects including board games, oils, and dishes. Map of Tutankhamun's Tomb by Ducksters Was there really a curse? At the time that King Tut's tomb was opened, many people thought that there was a curse that would affect anyone who invaded the tomb. When Lord Carnarvon died from a mosquito bite a year after entering the tomb, people were sure the tomb was cursed. Soon rumors began to spread that increased the belief and fear of the curse. Newspapers reported a curse inscribed on the door of the tomb. A story was told that Howard Carter's pet canary was eaten by a cobra on the day he entered the tomb. It was also said that 13 of the 20 people who were present at the opening of the burial chamber died within a few years. However, these were all just rumors. When scientists look at the number of people who died within 10 years of first entering the tomb, it is the same number as would normally be expected. Fun Facts about King Tut's Tomb Because it was so hot in Egypt, archeologists only worked during the winter season. The tomb is given the designation KV62. The KV stands for Valley of the Kings and the 62 is because it was the 62nd tomb found there. King Tut's gold mask was made with 22 pounds of gold. The treasures from King Tut's tomb traveled throughout the world during the Treasures of Tutankhamun tour from 1972 to 1979. Today, most of the treasures are exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

The original style of art was first used in 3000 B.C. and the most respected artists continued to copy these styles for the next 3000 years. Religion and Art Much of the artwork created by the Ancient Egyptians had to do with their religion. They would fill the tombs of the Pharaohs with paintings and sculptures. Much of this artwork was there to help the Pharaohs in the afterlife. Temples were another popular place for art. The temples often held large statues of their gods as well as many paintings on the walls. Egyptian Sculpture The Egyptians are famous for their giant works of sculptures.

Clothing as painted on a tomb wall Painting in the Tomb of Horemhab by Unknown Photo by the Yorck Project Wealthy people wore very soft linen clothes made from thin fibers. Poor people and peasants wore rougher linen clothing made from thicker fibers. Typical Clothing Clothing during Ancient Egypt was fairly simple. The linen cloth was typically white and seldom dyed another color. Very little sewing was done to items as most clothing was wrapped around and then held on with a belt. Also, the styles were generally the same for both the rich and the poor alike. Men wore wrap-around skirts similar to a kilt. The length of the skirt varied over the history of Ancient Egypt. Sometimes it was short and above the knee. At other times, the skirt was longer and went near the ankles. Women typically wore a long wrap-around dress that went down to their ankles. Dresses varied in style and may or may not have sleeves. Sometimes beads or feathers were used to decorate dresses. Did they wear shoes?

Both men and women wore lots of jewelry including heavy bracelets, earrings, and necklaces. One popular item of jewelry was the neck collar. Neck collars were made of bright beads or jewels and were worn on special occasions. Hair and Wigs Hairstyles were important and changed over time. Up until the Middle Kingdom time period, women usually wore their hair short. During and after the Middle Kingdom, they began to wear their hair longer. Men generally cut their hair short or even shaved their heads. Wealthy people, both men and women, often wore wigs. The more elaborate and jeweled the wig, the wealthier the person was. Makeup Makeup was an important part of Egyptian fashion. Both men and women wore makeup. They used a heavy black eye paint called "kohl" to decorate their eyes and covered their skin with creams and oils. The makeup did more than make them look good.

Chariot racing helped to hone the skills of chariot drivers and archery contests helped warriors improve their accuracy with the bow and arrow.

Stories were passed down from generation to generation orally. Festivals Throughout the year the Egyptians celebrated various festivals. Many of these were in honor of certain gods such as the Thoth festival. Festivals involved special offerings and celebrations.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Ancient Egyptian Gods and Goddesses History >> Ancient Egypt Religion played a big part in the lives of the Ancient Egyptians. They believed in a wide variety of gods and goddesses. These gods could take different forms, usually as animals. The same animal may represent a different god depending on the area, temple, or timeframe. Ra by Unknown Major Gods and Goddesses There were some gods and goddesses that were more important and prominent than others. Here are some of the more important ones: Ra - Ra was the sun god and the most important god to the Ancient Egyptians. Ra was drawn as a man with a hawk head and a headdress with a sun disk. At one point Ra was combined with another god Amun and the two made an even more powerful god, Amun-Ra. Ra was said to have created all forms of life and was the supreme ruler of the gods. Isis - Isis was the mother goddess. It was thought that she would protect and help people in need. She was drawn as a woman with a headdress in the shape of a throne. Osiris - Osiris was ruler of the underworld and god of the dead. He was the husband of Isis and father of Horus. Osiris was drawn as a mummified man with a feathered headdress. Horus - Horus was the god of the sky. Horus was the son of Isis and Osiris. He was drawn as a man with the head of a hawk. The ruler of the Egyptians, Pharaoh, was thought to be the living version Horus. In this way Pharaoh was the leader of the Egyptian religion and the people's representative to the gods. Thoth - Thoth was the god of knowledge. He blessed the Egyptians with writing, medicine, and mathematics. He was also god of the moon. Thoth is drawn as a man with an Ibis bird head. Sometimes he was represented as a baboon. Temples Many Pharaohs built large temples in honor of their gods. These temples would have large statues, gardens, memorials, and a place of worship. Towns would have their own temples as well for their own local gods. Luxor Temple at night by Spitfire ch Some famous temples include the Luxor Temple, the Temple of Isis at Philae, the Temple of Horus and Edfu, the Temples of Rameses and Nefertiti at Abu Simbel, and the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Was Pharaoh considered a god? The Ancient Egyptians considered Pharaoh to be their main intermediary to the gods; perhaps more of a high priest than a god. He was, however, closely associated with the god Horus and may have, at times, been considered a god in human form. Afterlife The Book of the Dead - Drawn on the walls of a tomb by Jon Bodsworth The Egyptians believed that there was a life after death. They thought that people had two important parts: a "ka", or life force that they only had while alive, and a "ba" which was more like a soul. If the "ka" and "ba" could be united in the afterworld the person would live in the afterlife. A key component was that the body be preserved for this to happen. This is why the Egyptians used the embalming process, or mummification, to preserve the dead. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Temples and Priests History >> Ancient Egypt Why did they build temples? The pharaohs of Egypt built the temples as houses for the Egyptian gods. Inside the temples, priests performed rituals in hopes of gaining the favor of the gods and to protect Egypt from the forces of chaos. There were two main types of temples built in Ancient Egypt. The first type is called a Cultus temple and was built to house a specific god or gods. The second type is called a Mortuary temple and was built to worship a dead pharaoh. Relief painting of a priestby Unknown Typical Design Over time, the temples of Ancient Egypt grew into large complexes with many buildings. At the center of the temple was the inner chambers and the sanctuary which housed a statue of the god. This is where the high priest would hold rituals and give offerings to the god. Only the priests could enter these sacred buildings. Around the sanctuary, other smaller rooms would hold lesser gods and companions to the primary god of the temple. Outside the inner chambers would be other buildings including large halls filled with columns and open courts. The entrance to the temple often had tall pylons that served as guardians to the temples. Priests Working in the temples were the priests and priestesses. There was typically a high priest that was assigned by the pharaoh. The high priest performed the most important rituals and managed the business of the temple. Working as a priest was considered a good job and was a sought after position by wealthy and powerful Egyptians. Priests had to be pure in order to serve the gods. They washed twice a day, shaved their heads, and wore only the cleanest linen clothing and leopard skins. Rituals Priests performed daily rituals in the temples. Every morning the high priest would enter the sanctuary and anoint the god's statue with sacred oil and perfume. He would then put ceremonial clothing and paint on the statue. After that he would make offerings of food such as bread, meat, and fruit. Other rituals and offerings would be made throughout the day in shrines outside the inner sanctuary. Rituals sometimes included music and hymns. Festivals Throughout the year, the temples would celebrate events with festivals. Many festivals were open to the local people and not just the priests. Some of the festivals involved large processions where one god would visit the temple of another god. Economics The larger temple complexes were major economic hubs in Ancient Egypt. They employed thousands of workers to supply food, jewelry, and clothing for the offerings as well as the many priests. The temples often owned land and collected grain, gold, perfumes, and other gifts from people wanting to earn the favor of the gods. Interesting Facts about the Temples and Priests of Ancient Egypt Columns and pillars in the temples often were designed in the shape of sacred plants such as papyrus and lotus. These plants were believed to grow on the mythical Island of Creation. Sometimes priests served as judges for the local people. The temples grew in size over time as new pharaohs added to them. Some temples started out as small shrines in early Egyptian history and ended up as large complexes by the end of the New Kingdom period. The high priest was a powerful person in both Egyptian society and the government. Grain surpluses held by the temples helped to feed the people during times of famine.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Mummies History >> Ancient Egypt The afterlife was an important part of Ancient Egyptian culture. One of the ways they prepared for the afterlife was to try and preserve the body as long as possible. They did this through a process called embalming. These embalmed bodies are called mummies. Coffin and mummy of pharaoh Amenhotep I by G. Elliot Smith How did they embalm the mummies? The Egyptians went through an elaborate process to preserve the body and keep it from decaying. It's a little gross, so we won't go into too much of the gory details. The main thing they did was try to get all the water and moisture out of the body. It's water that causes much of the decay. The Egyptians started out by covering the body with a salty crystal substance called natron. The natron would help to dry out the body. They would also take out some of the organs. With the body covered and stuffed with natron, they would let the body dry out for around 40 days. Once it was dry, they would use lotions on the skin to preserve it, reinforce the empty body with packing, and then cover the body in wraps of linen. They would use many layers of strips of linen wrapping, covering the entire body. Resin was used to glue the layers of wrap together. The total process could take up to 40 days. Once the body was all wrapped up, it was covered in a sheet called a shroud and placed in a stone coffin called a sarcophagus. Why did they care so much about the dead bodies? The tomb of Sennedjem by Unknown In the Egyptian religion, the body was needed in order for the soul or "ba" of the person to unite with the "ka" of the person in the afterlife. The body was an important part of the afterlife and they wanted to preserve it forever. Did everyone get this fancy embalming? Only the very rich could afford the best embalming. It was important to everyone, though, so they got the best that they could pay for and most of the dead were made into mummies. It is estimated that 70 million mummies were made in Egypt over the 3,000 years of the ancient civilization. Famous Mummies Tut's Tomb from the New York Times There are still mummies of some of the ancient Pharaohs around. Both Tutankhamun and Rameses the Great were preserved and can be seen at museums. Fun Facts about Egyptian Mummies Over the past few thousands of years, many of the Egyptian mummies have been destroyed in interesting ways. Some were burned for fuel, some were ground into powder to make magical potions, and some were destroyed by treasure hunters. The heart was left in the body because it was considered to be the center of intelligence. The brain was thrown away because it was thought to be useless. Sometimes the mummy's mouth would be opened to symbolize breathing in the afterlife. It is probably this custom that led to the superstition that mummies come back to life. Mummies are studied by scientists without unwrapping them by using CAT scan and X-Ray machines. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Book of the Dead Back to Ancient Egypt for Kids What is the Book of the Dead? The Book of the Dead is a series of written spells that the Ancient Egyptians believed helped them in the afterlife. It isn't one giant book, but is more of a bunch of individual chapters. Where were the spells written? The spells from the Book of the Dead were written on papyrus sheets or on the walls of the tomb. Scribes used hieroglyphics to write down the spells. They also illustrated the stories of the Book of Dead with colorful pictures. How many chapters were there? There were at least 190 different chapters of the Book of the Dead. Earlier chapters and spells had no structure. They were just a bunch of individual spells. Later, the chapters began to be more organized. The first 16 chapters described the dead person entering the tomb and then the underworld. The next section explained how the gods could help the person in the afterlife. This was followed by chapters describing the travels of the person in the underworld. The final section described how the person could become powerful during the afterlife. How old is the Book of the Dead? Book of the Dead chapters and spells were first written down on papyrus around 1600 BC. However, it is likely that some of the spells were much older than this. Did everyone have a Book of the Dead in their tomb? Not every Book of the Dead was the same. The wealthy could afford to hire a scribe to make a special Book of the Dead for them with specific spells they thought they would need in the afterlife. Poorer people could buy pre-written versions where the scribe would enter their name into the blanks. Either way, it was a big expense to have a Book of the Dead and not everyone could afford one. Why did the Egyptians want this in their tomb? Preparing for the afterlife was a big part of the Egyptian religion. They spent a lot of time and money on preparing their tombs and making sure they would have all the stuff they needed in the afterlife. They felt that the spells contained in the Book of the Dead would help protect them from demons, give them strength to travel in the underworld, and even win them a place in heaven. Examples of Chapters from the Book of the Dead Chapter 1 - Used on the day of burial for the funeral procession. Chapter 5 - A formula that prevented the person from having to work in the afterlife. Chapter 30 - A spell that prevented the heart of a man from being taken from him in the afterlife. Chapter 33 - A spell that helped to fight against snakes. Chapter 63 - A spell that helped the person to get drinking water in the underworld. Chapter 88 - A spell that would turn the person into the form of a crocodile. Chapter 125 - Perhaps the most famous chapter, chapter 125 describes the judging of a person's soul by the god Osiris. The person's heart was placed on a scale and weighed against the feather of Maat, which represented the truth. Chapter 185 - A hymn to the god Osiris. Interesting Facts about the Book of the Dead Some versions of the Book of the Dead were over 100 feet long. The Egyptian name for the Book of the Dead is translated as "The Spells of Coming Forth by Day". The text was usually written in black ink with the titles written in red. The book describes creatures guarding the underworld with scary names like "He who lives on snakes" and "He who dances in blood". One of the most famous examples of the Book of the Dead is the Papyrus of Ani which you can see in the British Museum in London. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Government History >> Ancient Egypt The Ancient Egyptian Government was ruled first and foremost by the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh was the supreme leader not only of the government, but also of the religion. However, the Pharaoh couldn't run the government all by himself, so he had a hierarchy of rulers and leaders below him who ran different aspects of the government. Vizier The Primary leader of the Government under the Pharaoh was the Vizier. The vizier was the Chief Overseer of the land, sort of like a Prime Minister. All the other officials reported into the vizier. Perhaps the most famous vizier was the first one, Imhotep. Imhotep architected the first pyramid and was later made into a god. The Egyptian law stated that the vizier was to 1) act by the law 2) judge fairly and 3) not act willfully or headstrong. Nomarks Under the vizier were local governors called Nomarks. Nomarks ruled over an area of land called a nome. A nome was like a state or province. Nomarks were sometimes appointed by the Pharaoh, while at other times the position of nomark would be hereditary and handed down from father to son. Other Officials Other officials that reported into Pharaoh were the army commander, the chief treasurer, and the minister of public works. These officials each had different responsibilities and powers, but Pharaoh had the final say. Many of the Pharaoh's officials were priests and scribes. Scribes were important to the government as they kept track of the finances and recorded taxes and the census. Overseers of the land were also appointed to keep track of the farmers and to make sure they were doing their jobs. Monarchy The average person had no say in the government. However, because Pharaoh was considered a god, and the people's representative to the gods, they often accepted the Pharaoh as their supreme leader without complaint. Fun Facts about the Ancient Egyptian Government The wives of the Pharaohs were the second most powerful people in the land after the Pharaohs. Citizens had to pay taxes to support the government. In the New Kingdom, court cases were ruled by a local council of elders called a Kenbet. Pharaohs would hold court for his top officials and high priests. People would approach him and kiss the ground at his feet. They did not have a complicated set of laws and statutes. In many cases the judges were to rule using common sense in an effort to come to an agreement. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

Queen Nefertari on Tomb Wall Photo by the Yorck Project Education Because women did not become scribes or work in the government, they did not learn how to read or write. They were taught homemaking skills and how to manage a household by their mother. Marriage Girls in Ancient Egypt got married very young. Usually around the age of twelve or thirteen. The Egyptians did not have big marriage ceremonies and most marriages were arranged by the two families. Typical Roles Women typically worked around the home. They prepared food, cooked meals, cleaned the house, made clothing, and took care of the children. Poor women would help their husbands work the fields. Wealthier women would manage the servants or perhaps run a business of their own. Preparing Food Preparing food for the family was a full time job for most peasant women. They would tend the garden, ground grain into flour, knead flour into dough, and cook bread. Wealthy Women Wealthy women would have had servants to do most of the housework and cooking. They would spend their time managing the servants and planning large banquets. Sometimes wealthy or high-ranking women became priestesses working in a temple for one of the Egyptian goddesses. Priestesses and Goddesses Only women from important and high-ranking families would have been allowed to become priestesses. Working in a temple was considered an honor. There were many powerful women goddesses in the Egyptian religion including Isis (the mother goddess), Hathor (goddess of love and motherhood), and Nut (goddess of the sky). Other Jobs Not all women worked in the family home or conformed to the typical roles of women. In Ancient Egyptian society this was okay. Women owned businesses selling products such as cosmetics, perfume, or clothing. Some women worked as entertainers in the courts as musicians or dancers. Rulers and Leaders Although women had less opportunity than men, they had the same legal rights. In some cases, this allowed a woman to rise all the way in power to become pharaoh. Two of the most famous women pharaohs were Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII. Interesting Facts about Women in Ancient Egypt Husbands and wives were generally buried together in the same tomb. Pharaohs were the exception and were usually buried separately from their wives. Family was very important to the Ancient Egyptians. Most men only had one wife and both men and women were expected to be loyal to their spouse. Women wore long, lightweight dresses made of linen. They also wore jewelry and makeup to protect their eyes and skin. Although women had equal rights under the law, they were generally considered lower than men in Ancient Egyptian society.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Hieroglyphics Papyrus of Ani from the Bridgeman Art Library [Public Domain] History >> Ancient Egypt The Ancient Egyptians used picture words to write called hieroglyphics. It is a very old form of writing that they starting using as early as 3000 B.C. Hieroglyphics was a very complicated way of writing involving 1000s of symbols. Some of the symbols represented sounds, like our letters, and other's represented entire words. More about Hieroglyphics Hieroglyphics was different from how we write in many ways: It could be written in almost any direction; left to right, right to left, or top to bottom. The reader would figure out which way to read it by the direction of the symbols. They didn't use any punctuation. One of the goals in writing hieroglyphics was that the writing would look like art and be beautiful to look at. A single picture symbol could stand for a whole word, called an ideogram, or a sound, called a phonogram. For example, a picture of an eye could mean the word "eye" or the letter "I". Scribes Since writing in hieroglyphics was so complicated, it took years of education and practice to be able to do it. The people who trained to write were called scribes. They would start training at a very young age of six or seven. Being a scribe was a good job in Ancient Egypt. Scribes didn't have to pay taxes or enter the army. They were very highly thought of and only the children of the wealthy got the opportunity to train as scribes. Papyrus The Ancient Egyptians often wrote on tablets or walls, but they also wrote on a type of paper called papyrus. Papyrus paper was made from a tall reed like plant called Papyrus. The Egyptians would use strips of the inner stem of the plant to make the paper. They would make two layers of strips; one horizontal and the other vertical. Then they would cover it in a linen cloth and apply pressure with a mallet or stones. The strips would bind together over time making a single flat sheet to write on. Rosetta Stone Rosetta Stone Source: the website of the European Space Agency In 1799 a French soldier found a special stone in the city of Rosetta. This stone had the same message written in both hieroglyphics and Greek. This was important because it helped to translate what the hieroglyphics said and could be used to help translate other hieroglyphics as well. Fun Facts about Egyptian Hieroglyphics Sometimes scribes used a faster short form of hieroglyphics on papyrus called hieratic. When the Greeks took over Egypt, many scribes had to learn Greek as well. A very famous scribe was Imhotep. He became high priest of the sun god, designed the first pyramid, and was later turned into a god. Most of the Ancient Egyptians could not read or write.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Egypt Hieroglyphic Examples and Alphabet History >> Ancient Egypt Types of Symbols When archeologists first studied Egyptian hieroglyphics they thought that each symbol represented a word. However, it turns out that the writing is more complex than that. A symbol can represent a word, a sound, a syllable, or a concept. Words In some cases, the symbol represents a full word. These symbols are called ideograms or logograms. You can see in the picture on the right how the symbol of the woman simply means the word "woman". The same with the man. Some symbols may represent more than one word depending on the context of how they are used and the other symbols around them. The same symbol used for "sun" can also mean "light." Alphabet Just like in our writing, some Ancient Egyptian symbols represented a sound. These symbols are called phonograms. We've shown in the picture below some comparisons of symbols and how they might relate to our alphabet. You will note that there are cases where two different symbols have the same sound (see the letter "Y" at the bottom). This is just like we have when some of our letters can make the same sound depending on the word (for example "c" and "k"). Ancient Egyptian Alphabet Syllable Some symbols represented a full syllable of two or three consonants. These symbols are also called phonograms. Examples include sounds like "sh" or "ch." Concept Other symbols helped with the overall concept of a word or idea. These symbols are called determinatives. In some cases, two words may sound the same but have different meanings. Sort of like the words "see" and "sea.". They sound the same, but have different meanings. Determinatives were used to distinguish between these types of words. One type of determinative was the symbol of a man (see the picture to the right). It gives the masculine meaning to a word "father." Sometimes two or more symbols together had a specific meaning. Like the three lines in a row which mean that the word was plural. Sort of like adding an "s" to a word. Numbers The Egyptians also had hieroglyphs for numbers. Their number system was based on the scale of ten like ours. You can see the symbols they used for numbers in the pictures below. They used a single line to represent a 1; a heel bone for 10; a coil of rope for 100; a water lily for 1,000; a bent finger for 10,000; a frog or a tadpole for 100,000; and the god Heh for 1,000,000. The symbols were written together to make up more complex numbers. For example, the number 123 would have a coil of rope, 2 heal bones, and three lines. Just like words and letters, the numbers could be written left to right, right to left, or top to bottom. Interesting Facts about the Hieroglyphic Alphabet The Ancient Egyptians called their writing the "language of the gods." The code of how Egyptian hieroglyphs can be translated was discovered by Jean-Francois Champollion in 1822. In mathematics, the "walking" symbol (see above) was used for addition and the "backwards" symbol (see above) was used for subtraction. There were no hieroglyphic words for the common English words "the", "a", or "and." *Pictures copyright Ducksters. Do not copy. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Mesopotamia Daily Life History >> Ancient Mesopotamia With the start of the Sumerian civilization, daily life in Mesopotamia began to change. Prior to the growth of cities and large towns, people lived in small villages and most people hunted and gathered. There wasn't a lot of variety in jobs or daily life. Assyrian Musicians by Unknown With the growth of large cities, things changed. There were all sorts of jobs and activities. While many people still worked as farmers in the country, in the city a person could grow up to work in a number of different jobs such as priest, scribe, merchant, craftsman, soldier, civil servant, or laborer. Different Classes of People With people moving to towns and governments being formed, society was dividing into different classes of people for perhaps the first time. At the top of society was the king and his family. The priests were considered near the top as well. The rest of the upper class was made up of the wealthy such as high level administrators and scribes. Below the upper class was a small middle class made up of craftsman, merchants, and civil servants. They could make a decent living and could work hard to try and move up in class. The lower class was made up of laborers and farmers. These people lived a harder life, but could still work their way up with hard work. At the bottom were the slaves. Slaves were owned by the king or bought and sold among the upper class. Slaves were usually people who were captured in battle. Chariot from the Encyclopedia Biblica What type of homes did they live in? Most people lived in mud brick homes. They were rectangular in shape and had two to three levels. The roofs were flat and people would often sleep on the roofs during the hot summers. The mud brick worked as a good insulator and helped to keep the homes a bit cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. Entertainment As the cities of Mesopotamia grew wealthy, there were more resources and free time for people to enjoy entertainment. They enjoyed music at festivals including drums, lyres, flutes, and harps. They also enjoyed sports such as boxing and wrestling as well as board games and games of chance using dice. The children of the time would have had toys to play with such as tops and jump ropes. Art and poetry was a big part of the wealthier cities. Most of the poetry and art had a religious theme or honored the king of the city. Storytellers would have passed stories down over generations with some of the more popular stories eventually being written down on clay tablets by scribes. Clothing Clothing was typically made from sheepskin or wool. The men wore kilt-like skirts and the women wore longer dresses. They enjoyed wearing jewelry, especially rings. The women braided their long hair, while the men had long hair and beards. Both men and women wore makeup. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.

History Biography Geography Science Games Ancient Mesopotamia Artisans and Craftsmen History >> Ancient Mesopotamia Artisans played an important role in the culture of the Mesopotamian people. They made everyday useful items like dishes, pots, clothing, baskets, boats, and weapons. They also created works of art meant to glorify the gods and the king. Chariots by O.Mustafin Potters The most common material for Mesopotamian artists was clay. Clay was used for pottery, monumental buildings, and tablets used to record history and legends. The Mesopotamians developed their skills in pottery over thousands of years. At first they used their hands to make simple pots. Later they learned how to use a potter's wheel. They also used high temperature ovens to harden the clay. They learned how to make different shapes, glazes, and patterns. Soon their pottery turned into works of art. Jewelers Fine jewelry was a status symbol in Ancient Mesopotamia. Both men and women wore jewelry. Jewelers used fine gemstones, silver, and gold to make intricate designs. They made all sorts of jewelry including necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. Metalsmiths Around 3000 BC the metal workers of Mesopotamia learned how to make bronze by mixing tin and copper. They would melt the metal at very high temperatures and then poor it into moulds to make all sorts of items including tools, weapons, and sculptures. Carpenters Carpenters were important craftsmen in Ancient Mesopotamia. The most important items were made with imported wood such as cedar wood from Lebanon. They built palaces for the kings using cedar. They also constructed chariots for war and ships to travel on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Many fine pieces of wooden craftsmanship were decorated with inlays. They would take small pieces of glass, gems, shells, and metal to make beautiful and shiny decorations on items like furniture, religious pieces, and musical instruments. Stone Masons Some of the best surviving work of Mesopotamian art and craftsmanship was carved by stonemasons. They carved everything from large sculptures to small detailed reliefs. Most of the sculptures had religious or historical significance. They were usually of the gods or the king. They also carved small detailed cylinder stones that were used as seals. These seals were quite small because they were used as signatures. They were also quite detailed so they couldn't be easily copied. Cylinder Seal from Walters Art Museum Interesting Facts about Mesopotamian Artisans and Art Sumerian sculptures of men usually had long beards and wide open eyes. The Ancient Greeks were influenced by Assyrian art. One example is the Assyrian winged genie which took the form of winged beasts such as the Griffin and the Chimera in Greek art. In the wealthier cities, even the gates to the city became works of art. One example of this is the Ishtar Gate of Babylon built by King Nebuchadnezzar II. It is covered with colorful glazed bricks showing designs and pictures of animals. Pottery and sculptures were often painted. A lot of Sumerian jewelry was recovered from the Royal Tombs of Ur. Sumerian artisans also learned how to make glass about 3500 BC. Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page.
